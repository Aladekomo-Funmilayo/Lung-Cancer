I'm excited to share my second analysis built in Excel.

Taking a step further in my career as a data analyst, here's a medical dataset and inclusive are insights for decision making.

Metrics on Insights
1. Overall survival rate is 22%
2. Most common case stage according to this dataset is "Stage III"
3. Highest survival by treatment effectiveness is "Surgery and Chemotherapy"
4. Worst survival by smkoing is "Never Smoked", possibly due to late diagnosis or other hidden factors
5. Age group with highest survival is "Young Adult"
6. Age group with lowest survival is "Advanced Adults"

Decision making derieved from insights.
  1. Early dectection is important; recommendation, implementationof awareness campaign and early screening program
  2. Rethink risk profile, even non-smokers show poor survival in this dataset; recommendation. expand diagnosis focus beyond smokers, consider, genetics, environment, e.t.c
  3. Proritize effective treatment, Chemotherapy and surgery shows the highest survival rate; recommendation, prioritizing availability or integration of equipments and surgeons.
  4. Age sensitivity intervention, according to this dataset, "Advanced Adults" have the lowest survival, possibly due to Co-morbidity ( the similaneous presence of two or more medical conditions); recommendation, launch age focused screening and treatment focus
  5. Resource allocation, use the pattern of the most effective treatment to allocate oncology resouces.
